## Before You Begin

- This version of birria ramen was inspired by the one served at Rollies Mexican Patio in Tucson, Arizona. You can modify the toppings to suit your taste. This recipe can easily be doubled.

## Why This Recipe Works

This deeply comforting soup is a surprising combination of elements of traditional Mexican beef birria tacos and Japanese ramen noodle soup. Inspired by the birria ramen served by Chef-Owner Mateo Otero at Rollies Mexican Patio in Tucson, Arizona, the broth is the chile-and-spice-infused braising liquid used to slow-cook beef chuck for another Rollies specialty, quesabirria tacos. Tender ramen noodles were added to the broth and then topped with shredded beef, chopped cabbage, cilantro, scallions, and jalapeño.
